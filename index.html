                    <p class="Early-academics1">
                        In 1957, Norman received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[7] Norman received a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.[8] He received a PhD in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania.[8] He was one of the earliest graduates from the Mathematical Psychology group at University of Pennsylvania and his advisor was Duncan Luce.[8]

                        After graduating, Norman took up a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University[9][10] and within a year became a lecturer.
                        
                        After four years with the Center, Norman took a position as an associate professor in the Psychology Department at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Norman applied his training as an engineer and computer scientist, and as an experimental and mathematical psychologist, to the emerging discipline of cognitive science. Norman eventually became founding chair of the Department of Cognitive Science and chair of the Department of Psychology.
                        
                        At UCSD, Norman was a founder of the Institute for Cognitive Science and one of the organizers of the Cognitive Science Society (along with Roger Schank, Allan Collins, and others), which held its first meeting at the UCSD campus in 1979.[11][non-primary source needed]
                        
                        Together with psychologist Tim Shallice, Norman proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning.[when?] One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system.[12]

                    <h3> Cognitive engineering career </h3>
                    <p class="Cognitive-engineering-career1">
                        Norman made the transition from cognitive science to cognitive engineering by entering the field as a consultant and writer. His article "The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid"[13] in Datamation (1981) catapulted him to a position of prominence in the computer world.[citation needed] Soon after, his career took off outside of academia, although he still remained active at UCSD until 1993. Norman continued his work to further human-centered design by serving on numerous university and government advisory boards such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He currently serves on numerous committees and advisory boards like at Motorola, the Toyota National College of Technology, TED Conference, Panasonic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and many more.

                        Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the 1979, Three Mile Island nuclear accident.[14]
                        
                        In 1993, Norman left UCSD to join Apple Computer, initially as an Apple Fellow as a User Experience Architect (the first use of the phrase "User Experience" in a job title[15][16][citation needed]), and then as the Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group. He later worked for Hewlett-Packard before joining with Jakob Nielsen to form the Nielsen Norman Group in 1998. He returned to academia as a professor of computer science at Northwestern University, where he was co-director of the Segal Design Institute until 2010. In 2014, he returned to UCSD to become director of the newly established The Design Lab housed at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology.
                        
                        In 2014, Norman returned to the University of California, San Diego as newly appointed director of The Design Lab.[17]

                    <h3> Awards </h3>
                    <p class="Awards1">
                        Norman has received many awards for his work. He received two honorary degrees, one "S. V. della laurea ad honorem" in Psychology from the University of Padua in 1995 and one doctorate in Industrial Design and Engineering from Delft University of Technology.[18][8] In 2001, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and won the Rigo Award from SIGDOC, the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group (SIG) on the Design of Communication (DOC).[19] In 2006, he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science.[7] In 2009, Norman was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Design Research Society.
